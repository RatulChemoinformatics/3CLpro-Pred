Project Description: In this project, we developed advanced machine learning-based QSAR models to predict the inhibitory potential of diverse SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibitors, an essential drug target for COVID-19 treatment. Using a dataset of 919 molecules from the ChEMBL database, we combined molecular descriptors, substructure fingerprints, and Random Forest algorithms to construct robust models with high predictive accuracy, achieving correlation coefficients of 97.36% (training) and 74.70% (test). Molecular docking and dynamic simulations further validated the predictions by analyzing atomic-level interactions between candidate inhibitors and the 3CL protease, identifying critical residues like His164, Glu166, and Gln189. A user-friendly Python-based web application, **3CLpro-Pred**, was developed to facilitate bioactivity predictions for novel compounds, streamlining virtual screening processes. System biology analyses were integrated to explore compound-target-pathway interactions, uncovering significant genes (e.g., PIK3CA, CASP3, and TBK1) and enriched pathways, such as TNF signaling and PI3K-Akt pathways, implicated in viral replication and immune responses. Compound **F0648-0705** emerged as a top candidate, demonstrating strong binding affinity and stable molecular interactions comparable to known drugs like Boceprevir. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed its stability within the protease's active site. This study highlights the value of combining cheminformatics, molecular modeling, and system biology to identify promising antiviral candidates, paving the way for further experimental validation. The **3CLpro-Pred** tool and insights into key molecular features provide a comprehensive framework for rational drug design against SARS-CoV-2.
